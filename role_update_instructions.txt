Role Update Implementation Instructions
======================================

We have updated the user management system to support three distinct roles:
1. Administrator - Full system access
2. Member - SRC Member with expanded permissions
3. Student - Regular student with limited access

Changes Made:
------------
1. Updated the user role dropdown in the Add New User form to include:
   - Student
   - Member
   - Administrator

2. Updated the role filter in the user listing to include:
   - Administrator
   - Member
   - Student

3. Updated the role badge styling to use appropriate colors:
   - Administrator: Red badge
   - Member: Blue badge
   - Student: Light blue badge

4. Created a database update script (update_roles_web.php) to:
   - Modify the role column to support the three roles
   - Update any existing users with 'user' role to 'student'
   - Add documentation to the table

To Complete the Implementation:
-----------------------------
1. Run the database update script by visiting:
   http://localhost/srcwebsite/update_roles_web.php
   
2. Verify that the roles are working correctly by:
   - Creating a new user with each role type
   - Checking that the role badges display correctly
   - Testing that permissions work correctly for each role

3. Update any other parts of the system that might reference user roles:
   - Check auth_functions.php to ensure role-based permissions are correct
   - Update any other forms that might create or modify users
   - Review any role-based access control logic in other parts of the application

Note: The auth_functions.php file already includes functions for checking each role type:
- isAdmin() - Checks if user has administrator role
- isMember() - Checks if user has member role  
- isStudent() - Checks if user has student role

These functions can be used throughout the application to control access based on role.
